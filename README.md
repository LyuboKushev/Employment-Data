# Employment-Data
Project on Employment Data (Bulgaria)

# TODOs
## Data to gather
* stars for the job and the color for the rating
* get the html for each job
* get the technologies for the position
* get the views for each job
* Extract the location for each job https://github.com/dbonev91/Bulgaria-Towns-JSON

## Ideas for Analysis
* position seasonality
* salary ranges
* job distribtion according to towns
* job position distribution according to companies
* rating (Are the paid jobs reach more people? Are companies promoting specific position more than others)
* most common benefits
* seniority for position
