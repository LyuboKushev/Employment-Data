# Employment-Data
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks which allows an user to scrape job details from the jobs.bg web application. Currently, we're using Selenium and Beautiful Soup for the most of the job.

# TODOs
## Data to gather
* Extract the location for each job https://github.com/dbonev91/Bulgaria-Towns-JSON

## Ideas for Analysis
* position seasonality
* salary ranges
* job distribtion according to towns
* job position distribution according to companies
* rating (Are the paid jobs reach more people? Are companies promoting specific position more than others)
* most common benefits
* seniority for position
